# clubMembershipProgram
This program was created for my programming 1 final project.

It has a simple console menu that allows you to create a list of members of a club. 

This program allows you to:

Open a current list (if there is a CSV in same folder)
Add club members, 
Display members, 
Delete member, 
Change member's membership level, 
Search for a member, 
Save (to a .CSV) and quit 


You must give the following information for each member when created:

Age, 
Fights Won, 
First and Last Name, 
Membership Fee, 
and Membership Level
